/**
 * Once you have finished using a thread executor, it is important that you call the shutdown()
 * method. A thread executor creates a non-daemon thread on the first task that is executed, so
 * failing to call shutdown() will result in your application never terminating.
 * The shutdown process for a thread executor involves first rejecting any new tasks sub-
 * mitted to the thread executor while continuing to execute any previously submitted tasks.
 * During this time, calling isShutdown() will return true, while isTerminated() will
 * return false. If a new task is submitted to the thread executor while it is shutting down,
 * a RejectedExecutionException will be thrown. Once all active tasks have been com-
 * pleted, isShutdown() and isTerminated() will both return true. FigureÂ 13.3 shows the
 * life cycle of an ExecutorService object.
